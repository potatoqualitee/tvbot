<p>&nbsp;</p>


## Install

To get started, you'll need to generate a Twitch token then install the module.

### Get a token from Twitch
Get an API key from Twitch from [twitchtokengenerator.com](https://twitchtokengenerator.com/) or [twitchapps.com/tmi](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).

### Install the bot
Next, change your execution policy, if needed, then install `tvclient` from the PowerShell Gallery.

```
# Set execution policy to allow local scripts
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# OPTIONAL: Trust the Microsoft Gallery to avoid prompts
Set-PSRepository PSGallery -InstallationPolicy Trusted

# Install the tvclient PowerShell module
Install-Module tvclient
```

## Config

Once `tvclient` is installed, set your client id and token using the token generated earlier.

```
$splat = @{
    ClientId = "abcdefh01234567ijklmop"
    Token    = "01234567fghijklmnopqrs"
}
